The Real-Time Smile Detector (RTSD) is a deep learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a smile in real-time. The model is implemented in PyTorch and is based on a MobileNetV3 backbone architecture. Given an input face image, the RTSD outputs a smile score, representing the confidence of the model that the face is smiling. The model has been trained on the CelebA dataset, which provides a large and balanced set of high-quality images of smiling and non-smiling faces. This dataset was selected for its ease of access and the high quality of the labeled images. The RTSD is capable of providing real-time smile predictions, making it an ideal solution for a wide range of applications.
